# Blog-project
Hi there!\
This is a blog I created using Django, although this is a pretty basic and preliminary one. I have done this project with the help of a course on Udemy by Mr.Justin Mitchel.\
To see what's cooking, make sure you got Django and python installed on your PC. Install any additional packages through pip command. Then:
1) Open Command line (preferably Ubuntu) in your PC.
2) Enter cd try_django/src
3) then type, python3 manage.py runserver
4) Now, the server gets started. Go to your local browser and enter the address given.
5) VoilÃ ! You can see the blog I created!\
->Tools used: Sublime Text.\
->Platform: Ubuntu.
